## Welcome to the Loreji Guide! 
This guide will try to learn you how to use Loreji and how to develop modules for Loreji.
Loreji is a powerfull webhosting management system for the simple and advanced user.**

** Why Loreji? **
The Loreji team did'nt want to use the system from ZPanel anymore. It has too many bugs
and through that in our eyes not secure. We wanted our own panel that is secure 
and an larger support for applications. 

** I see Node.JS **
Yes! Loreji is the FIRST webhosting panel that supports Node.JS out of the box!.
This is the same for MongoDB. We thing there projects are awesome, so they needed 
to be in Loreji.
